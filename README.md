### What does `pyvmd` do?

`pyvmd` automatizes the most tedious steps in generation of molecular
movies, i.e. scripting in TCL, rendering, generating overlays and
combining frames, as well as merging frames into the final movie.

We try to simplify the movie making syntax to supersede the existing
TCL UserAni library, and add extended functionalities such as
animating trajectory data with matplotlib, adding insets or
making multi-panel movies.

### Requirements

The internal workflow is as follows: generate the TCL script > run VMD
to render frames > post-process using imagemagick > combine frames
using ffmpeg. Therefore, full automation requires that `python3`, `VMD`,
`imagemagick` and `ffmpeg` be installed on the system you're using
to produce the movie. The good news is that it can be done externally,
e.g. on a remote workstation, once you set up the visualization state
locally.

Note:
+ It is recommended to use `python3` from the Anaconda distribution
as it contains `numpy` as a pre-installed package.
+ `VMD` can be obtained at `https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/`.
+ `imagemagick` is installed by default on most Linux distributions;
run e.g. `convert` to make sure it is available on your machine.
+ `ffmpeg` can be installed e.g. from the Ubuntu repository by
typing `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`.

### Usage

To use `pyvmd`, one needs:

1. a visualization state generated by VMD (user should define the
preferred representations as well as set the camera angle, and then
go to File > Save Visualization State);
1. a 'movie script', i.e. a textfile containing directives, including
a reference to the VMD visualization state (see examples and the
explanations below).

Sample movie scripts are available in the `examples` directory.

`pyvmd` can be run from the console as:

 `python pyvmd.py examples/simple_movie/script.txt`

### List of available action keywords and parameters:

+ animate (frames=init_frame:final_frame, t=...s, \[smooth=...\])
+ rotate (axis=x/y/z, angle=..., t=...s, \[sigmoid=**t**/f/sls\])
+ zoom_in/zoom_out (scale=..., t=...s, \[sigmoid=**t**/f/sls\])
+ make_transparent/make_opaque (material=..., t=...s,  \[sigmoid=**t**/f/sls\])
+ center_view (selection='...')
+ do_nothing (t=...s)

(Values in bold font indicate defaults when parameters are optional)

### List of available global keywords and parameters:

+ global (\[fps=20, draft=t/**f**, keepframes=t/**f**, name=**movie**\])
+ layout (not implemented yet)
+ scene_identifier (visualization=..., \[position=**1,1**, resolution=**1000,1000**\])

(instead of scene_identifier, you should put the actual identifier
of the scene in question, e.g. `scene_1` in the example below)

### Notes on input formatting:

+ A hash (\#) marks the beginning of a scene, and should contain
a single-word scene identifier,  e.g. `# scene_1`
+ Single actions have to be specified on a single line, starting with
a keyword and followed by `parameter=value` pairs (no spaces encircling
the `=` sign)
+ Multiple actions (e.g. rotation and zoom_in) can be performed
simultaneously if they are encircled in curly brackets and separated
with semicolons, e.g. `{rotate t=1s angle=50; zoom_in t=1s scale=2}`;
they can also be split over several lines for clarity
+ A line starting with a `$` sign specifies global keywords, e.g.
`$ global fps=20`
+ true/false values can be specified as `true/false`, `yes/no` or in
shorthand notation (`t/f`, `y/n`)
